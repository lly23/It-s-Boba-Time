Project 4 - Tying It All Together
Goal
For your final project, you will use all of the skills we've learned this semester to create a robust, interactive web experience. The app should cover a topic using a combination of text, graphics, video, audio, charts, and APIs.

You may choose any non-fiction topic you like, but choose wisely. Find a story that lends itself well to the interactive methods we've learned: APIs (e.g, news, twitter, maps, etc.), data viz (charts), plugins (e.g., parallax etc), and your own custom JS code. Think about how you can bring the story to life with these interactive features. Get creative. Follow your passion. If done right, this piece could be your calling card. Make it great, but also make it relevant to interests and ambitions. Current events and other 'hard' news stories are an obvious choice -- they lend themselves well to the methods above -- but you are not limited to that genre. Cover a topic that's important to you, a topic you would like to cover for a living. This is a media and journalism class, so your story cannot be entirely personal. It must be objective, well-researched, and properly cited. 

Requirements
At least three (3) APIs, one of which must be an API that you find, learn and implement on your own (e.g., something besides Google Maps, Flickr, YouTube, News.org or Twitter). There are more than 28,000 APIs available in this directory:  https://https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis
If your story is data-driven, you may substitute a chart for one of the APIs
At least one (1) interactive feature that you create from scratch with pure JS or jQuery, not a plugin. This may be, for example, an custom event that you attach to one of the APIs, something beyond what's already available in the API code templates and their built-in options (e.g., not just a tooltip). It may be an interactive element elsewhere in your app that has nothing to do with the APIs or charts (e.g., background photos that change in response to click events in the story). Get creative. Push yourself. Try new things. I'm looking for it.
Well-written text to introduce and develop your interactive content. Depending on your story, this may be nothing more than a headline and brief introduction. Other stories may require more traditional reporting, with full paragraphs and pull quotes. Regardless, the interactive media should be the focus of the piece.
Sources (with links), when applicable
Responsive design, using Grid, Flex, Bootstrap, etc. This needs to work on a phone and look good doing it. Remember: mobile first.

Grading
Code (35%)
Did you include all of the requirements?
Does everything work without glitches?
Is your code clean, efficient, and well-commented? Does it follow best practices?
Did you use GitHub on a regular basis?
Design (35%)
Is your app attractive, clean, consistent, and professional-looking?
Does the visual design fit the story?
Is the app user-friendly? Does it require instructions or extra navigational cues? Are the touch targets large enough on mobile?

Story (30%)
Is the story compelling and well-written?
Do the interactive features add value? Do they enhance the experience, or distract from it?
Do the APIs (social media feeds, maps, etc.) add to the story, or do they feel arbitrary, like they were thrown in to meet the requirements? (this is a big one)
If you have charts, are they clear, accurate and noteworthy?
